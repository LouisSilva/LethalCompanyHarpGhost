## 1.2.8
* Added the following configs:
    * Harp Ghost's max speed in chase mode
    * Harp Ghost's max acceleration in chase mode
    * Harp Ghost's enable red eyes when angry (is true by default)
    * Harp Ghost's attack cooldown
    * Harp Ghost's attack area length (how far the attack area reaches out pretty much)
  
* Changed the max open door speed config to "open door speed multiplier when in chase mode" because the previous one was a bit useless and didnt really make sense

## 1.2.7
* The harp ghost's eyes turn red when angry
* Reduced lag when the harp spawns (hopefully)

## 1.2.5
* Removed DissonanceLagFix as a hard dependency

## 1.2.4
* Fixed bug that makes the harp play different music for different people
* Changed the harp ghost's default attack damage to 45 from 35 (you can change the value with configs)
* Made the plugin try to load the instruments' audio files on startup to hopefully kill the lag caused when a harp is first played (music) in a game. The DissonanceLagFix mod is also now added as a dependency to help with the lag just in-case the plugin was unable to load the audio files on startup.   

## 1.2.3

* Fixed double harps appearing when ghost gets annoyed
* Changed network events to not static (which caused a plethora of other bugs)
