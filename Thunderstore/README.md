# Haunted Harpist [BETA]
**Adds to the game a new enemy called the Haunted Harpist.**
<p>The Haunted Harpist is an enemy that initially roams the map while playing its haunting melody on the harp. If provoked during its performance—whether by excessive noise, stunning, or direct attack—the Haunted Harpist will cease its serene music, dropping its harp to engage aggressively with anyone it perceives.</p>

<p>Dealing with the angry ghost may prove difficult, but it is worth it to obtain the harp.</p>

## WARNING: BETA

This mod is in beta, expect there to be occasional bugs (non game breaking ones) if you download the mod in this state *for now*.

Stuff to be done before the mod is taken out of beta:
 - [X] Make the increase fear mechanic work with clients
 - [ ] Fix shotgun invincibility
 - [ ] Add a couple more harp songs
 - [ ] Change scrap icon
 - [X] Give the ghost the ability to hear players if they are near them (when the ghost is in its aggressive state)
 - [ ] Add configs to change the ghost's health, annoyance threshold, spawn rates, etc
 - [ ] Make the search routines work outside the facility

## Bestiary Info

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
<br/>
<p>The ethereal entity known as the Haunted Harpist is categorized as a spectral presence of uncertain origin. Its form is reminiscent of the classic depiction of a phantom, lacking distinct humanoid features and attire, with an outline that shrouds its core in mystery. Its most notable characteristic is the ancient harp it perpetually clutches, strumming melodies that echo through the desolate halls of the mansion it inhabits.</p>


<p>If disturbed by excessive noise or a deliberate attempt to disrupt its eerie concerto, the Haunted Harpist will abandon its harmonious routine and become a relentless pursuer. For explorers encountering the Haunted Harpist, it is recommended to move with stealth and avoid interrupting its performance.</p>

## Future (possible) Updates

- Throw harp ability
- Spawn "enforcer bugs" which are aggressive hoarder bugs that solely want to get the harp back
- Mariachi band, when angered they all have shotguns (the reward for provoking them would be getting all their expensive instruments if you managed to kill them all)
- Punk rocker who can shoot lightning
- Pianist, violinist
  
Haven't really thought much about it yet.
