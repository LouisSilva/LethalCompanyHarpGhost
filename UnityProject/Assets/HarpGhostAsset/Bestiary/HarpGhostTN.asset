  displayText: 'The ethereal entity known as the Haunted Harpist is categorized as
    a spectral presence of uncertain origin. Its form is reminiscent of the classic
    depiction of a phantom, lacking distinct humanoid features and attire, with an
    outline that shrouds its core in mystery. Its most notable characteristic is
    the ancient harp it perpetually clutches, strumming melodies that echo through
    the desolate halls of the mansion it inhabits.


    If disturbed by excessive
    noise or a deliberate attempt to disrupt its eerie concerto, the Haunted Harpist
    will abandon its harmonious routine and become a relentless pursuer. For explorers
    encountering the Haunted Harpist, it is recommended to move with stealth and
    avoid interrupting its performance. '
